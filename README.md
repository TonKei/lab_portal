## Development Approach

This project follows **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** principles:

1. **Red**: Write failing tests for new functionality
2. **Green**: Implement minimal code to pass tests
3. **Refactor**: Improve code while maintaining test coverage

### Development Phases
1. **Phase 1**: Core development with direct installation
2. **Phase 2**: Containerization and testing
3. **Phase 3**: OVA creation and automation
4. **Phase 4**: Documentation and distribution

## Getting Started

### For Development
1. Set up Rocky Linux 9.x development environment
2. Follow the direct installation guide in [Deployment Strategy](DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md)
3. Review [Test Strategy](TEST_STRATEGY.md) for TDD workflow
4. Implement functions according to [Functional Requirements](FUNCTIONAL_REQUIREMENTS.md)

### For Production Deployment
1. Download the Lab Portal OVA template
2. Import into your virtualization platform
3. Follow the first-boot configuration wizard
4. Access the web interface and complete setup

### For Development/Testing
1. Use Podman container deployment
2. Follow container setup in [Deployment Strategy](DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md)
3. Access development environment
