## üîß Technical Stack Decisions

### Confirmed Technology Choices
- **Backend Framework:** Flask (traditional web app, admin panels, simpler deployment)
- **Frontend Approach:** Flask Templates + Bootstrap + Alpine.js (server-side rendering with progressive enhancement)
- **Database:** PostgreSQL (production) + SQLite (development)
- **CSS Framework:** Bootstrap 5 (professional UI, desktop-focused)
- **JavaScript Enhancement:** Alpine.js (lightweight reactivity)
- **Authentication:** Flask-Login + python-pam (database + PAM integration)
- **Real-time Features:** Flask-SocketIO (device status updates, notifications)
- **ORM:** SQLAlchemy
- **Testing:** pytest + coverage
- **Deployment:** OVA template (primary), Podman containers (secondary)

### Technology Stack Decisions
- **Status:** ‚úÖ ANALYSIS COMPLETE AND APPROVED
- **Document:** TECHNOLOGY_STACK.md with comprehensive functional requirements integration  
- **Final Architecture:** Flask + Bootstrap + Alpine.js + PostgreSQL/SQLite + PAM authentication
- **Asset Strategy:** Local asset delivery for OVA self-containment
- **Development Phases:** 4-phase roadmap with TDD approach

### Pending Technology Decisions
- [ ] **Python Version:** Determine optimal Python version for Rocky Linux 9.x deployment  
- [ ] **Dependency Compatibility:** Ensure all libraries support chosen Python version
- [ ] **PAM Integration Testing:** Validate python-pam compatibility with target Python version

## üìù Notes & Considerations

### Development Approach
- **TDD Focus:** Write tests first, implement functionality second
- **Incremental Development:** Each function should be fully functional before moving to next
- **Security First:** Authentication and authorization implemented early
- **Documentation:** Keep code well-documented and tested

### Key Integration Points
- **Function #1 ‚Üí All Functions:** Authentication required for most features
- **Function #5 ‚Üí Functions #3,8,9,10:** Device data dependency
- **Function #6 ‚Üí Functions #8,9:** Help and feedback integration
- **Function #7 ‚Üí Functions #8,9:** Navigation and UI framework

### Risk Considerations
- **PAM Integration Complexity:** May require system-level testing
- **Nmap Security:** Ensure proper sandboxing and security
- **Device Network Access:** Network scanning permissions and security
- **Multi-lab Deployment:** OVA template complexity
